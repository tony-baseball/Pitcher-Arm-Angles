# Frontier League Arm Angles

This repo works to infer arm angles for Frontier League pitchers using their height, release height, and release side using Yakkertech data. The original analysis was done in python by Github user [Trevor Thrash](https://github.com/trevorwthrash/armAngles). This is my attempt at recreating his methodology in R and creating different plots.

## Example Plots
